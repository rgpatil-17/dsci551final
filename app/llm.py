    IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
    1. **DO NOT USE IDs** (player_id, team_id, etc.) in the SELECT clause.
    2. **ENSURE THE QUERY IS COMPLETE AND EXECUTABLE**.  
    - The query **must be syntactically correct** and should not be truncated.
    - If subqueries are used, they must be properly structured and complete.
    - All column names and table names must be referenced correctly.
    3. **DEFINITION OF "BEST" TEAM**  
    - The best team is the one with the **highest `record_pct` (winning percentage)**.
    - If multiple teams have the same record percentage, sort them by **total wins**.
    - If there's still a tie, sort by **least losses**.
    - If the tie persists, sort alphabetically by team name.
    4. **I ONLY NEED A MySQL QUERY AND NOTHING ELSE.**
    5. **WHEN I ASK ABOUT BEST TEAM/PLAYER I NEED ONLY RECORDS WHICH IS THE BEST.**
    6. **ONLY return the MySQL query. No explanations, no extra text.**
    7. When inserting a new player, always set player_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(player_id), 0) + 1 FROM Players)
    8. When inserting a new player stat, always set stat_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(stat_id), 0) + 1 FROM Player_Stats)
    9. When inserting a new team, always set team_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(team_id), 0) + 1 FROM Teams)
    10. When inserting a new team stat, always set team_stat_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(team_stat_id), 0) + 1 FROM Team_Stats)
    11. When inserting a new game, always set game_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(game_id), 0) + 1 FROM Games)
    12. When inserting a new game stat, always set game_stat_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(game_stat_id), 0) + 1 FROM Game_Stats)
    13. For any INSERT operation, always explicitly insert a value for the primary key column using the format: (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(primary_key_column), 0) + 1 FROM Table)
    Example: INSERT INTO Teams (team_id, team_name, city, coach) VALUES ((SELECT COALESCE(MAX(team_id), 0) + 1 FROM Teams), 'ABC', 'X', 'Y');

    INSTRUCTIONS TO JOIN TWO TABLES: [UNDERSTAND WHICH COLUMNS BELONG TO WHICH TABLES AND THEN APPLY JOINING INSTRUCTIONS. APPLY THESE INSTRUCTIONS WHERE EVER REQUIRED]
    - **Join Players table and Player_Stats table use player_id column.**
    - **Join Players table and Teams table use team_id column.**
    - **Join Teams table and Team_Stats table use team_id column.**
    - **Join Teams table and Games table use team_id from Teams table and home_team_id or away_team_id column from Games table.**
    - **Join Teams table and Game_Stats table use team_id from Teams table and winner_id or loser_id column from Game_Stats table.**
    - **Join Games table and Game_Stats table use game_id column.**
    - **For example, to join Player_Stats and Teams table, join Player_Stats and Players on player_id and then join the result with Teams table using team_id of Players table and Teams table.**

    MOST IMPORTANT RULES:
    - Use MySQL syntax.
    - **ONLY return the MySQL query. No explanations, no extra text.**
    - **For "What are the tables?" → Use** `SHOW TABLES;`
    - **For "What are the columns in X table?" or "Send me the column names in X table" [The question means the output should only be column names from the table X]→ Use** `SELECT COLUMN_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'NBA_DB' AND TABLE_NAME = 'X';`
    - **For all other queries, generate standard MySQL queries using SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, etc.**
    - **DO NOT return explanations or markdown formatting—return only the MySQL query.**

    MOST IMPORTANT QUERIES:
    - **For "What players and their corresponding teams have an average of more than X assists per game?" → Use** `SELECT Players.name, Teams.team_name FROM Player_Stats JOIN Players ON Player_Stats.player_id = Players.player_id JOIN Teams ON Players.team_id = Teams.team_id WHERE Player_Stats.assists_per_game > X;`
    - **For "Who are the players ranked 6–15 in rebounds per game?" → Use** `SELECT Players.name, rebounds_per_game FROM Player_Stats JOIN Players ON Player_Stats.player_id = Players.player_id ORDER BY rebounds_per_game DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 5;`
    - **For "What are the average points scored by each winning team?" → Use** `SELECT Teams.team_name, AVG(Game_Stats.points_of_winner) AS avg_points_scored FROM Game_Stats JOIN Teams ON Game_Stats.winner_id = Teams.team_id GROUP BY Teams.team_name;`
    - **For "Which teams appear more than once as the home team?" → Use** `SELECT Teams.team_name FROM Games JOIN Teams ON Games.home_team_id = Teams.team_id GROUP BY Teams.team_name HAVING COUNT(Games.game_id) > 1;`
    - **For "Show me Y sample rows from the X table?" → Use** `SELECT * FROM X LIMIT Y;`
    - **When inserting a new player, always set player_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(p.player_id), 0) + 1 FROM (select * from Players) AS p)**
    - **When inserting a new player stat, always set stat_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(p.stat_id), 0) + 1 FROM (select * from Player_Stats) AS p)**
    - **When inserting a new team, always set team_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(t.team_id), 0) + 1 FROM (select * from Teams) AS t)**
    - **When inserting a new team stat, always set team_stat_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(t.team_stat_id), 0) + 1 FROM (select * from Team_Stats) AS t)**
    - **When inserting a new game, always set game_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(g.game_id), 0) + 1 FROM (select * from Games) AS g)**
    - **When inserting a new game stat, always set game_stat_id to (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(g.game_stat_id), 0) + 1 FROM (select * from Game_Stats) AS g)**
    - **For any INSERT operation, always explicitly insert a value for the primary key column using the format: (SELECT COALESCE(MAX(alias.primary_key_column), 0) + 1 FROM (select * from table) AS alias)
         Example: INSERT INTO Teams (team_id, team_name, city, coach) VALUES ((SELECT COALESCE(MAX(t.team_id), 0) + 1 FROM (select * from Teams) AS t), 'ABC', 'X', 'Y');**
    - **For "Insert a new team Rohits Ballers whose city is Rohitville and coach Rohit Patil into Teams table" → Use** `INSERT INTO Teams (team_id, team_name, city, coach) VALUES ((SELECT COALESCE(MAX(t.team_id), 0) + 1 FROM (select * from Teams) AS t),'Rohits Ballers', 'Rohitville', 'Rohit Patil');`
    - **For "Delete team 'Rohits Ballers'" → Use** DELETE FROM Teams WHERE team_name = 'Rohits Ballers';. Only send MySQL query and nothing apart from that. 
    - **For "Update coach to 'Rohit Patil' on team 'Washington Wizards'" → Use** `UPDATE Teams SET coach = 'Rohit Patil' WHERE team_name = 'Washington Wizards';`. Only send MySQL query and nothing apart from that.
    - **For "Update coach to 'X' on team 'Y'" → Use** `UPDATE Teams SET coach = 'X' WHERE team_name = 'Y';`. Only send MySQL query and nothing apart from that.
    
    
    Convert the following natural language query into a MySQL statement based on the above schema:

    {natural_language_query}

    **I need only MySQL Query and nothing else. Use database name or TABLE_SCHEMA as NBA_DB. The MySQL Query must be fully complete and correctly formatted.**
